# Elementary-OS-Wallpapers
This is a repository for wallpapers 🖼️, which I use in Elementary OS. Whenever I find a new wallpaper that looks good and is worth sharing, I will put it here so that people can find all my recommendations easily in one place.

## 🖼️ Submit
If you have a great wallpaper to recommend, you can either submit a PR or create an issue with a wallpaper link.
❗Make sure the wallpaper is free to use.

File should be named as

``wallpaper-name-by-author-name``
